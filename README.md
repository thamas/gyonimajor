Gy√≥ni Major
==========

This is the source code of the [http://www.gyonimajor.hu](http://www.gyonimajor.hu) site.

I used GH page generator for a quick start. 

I use [http://tags.brace.io](http://tags.brace.io) to simple templating. Its source folder is `btsrc` 

Focus was on adding content. 

I planned to restructure, refactor, use more tools etc. (
  I Started to add issues here, but switched to a private Trello board. 
  But if you are really interested in, here are some of my technical related plans with this micro site :)
  * responsive images using new HTML5 markup
  * HTML rtefactor to use HTML5
  * split the Sass source file and use a SMACS-like structure
  * use BEM(-like) naming in Sass 
  * async font load
  * use a static site generator(?)
)
